#+TITLE: @tintinthong's Karabiner Configuration

* Setup

#+begin_src bash
brew install yqrashawn/goku/goku
echo $GOKU_EDN_CONFIG_FILE # check if this is nil
export GOKU_EDN_CONFIG_FILE=$HOME/.config/karabiner/karabiner.edn
goku # Done!
#+end_src

* Does this configuration fit you?

** Ideal User
- A vim user
- A touch-typist
- Someone who seeks a keyboard-only workflow
- Someone locked into the MacOs Ecosystem
- Someone planning to invest in a 40% keyboard

** Applications I optimise
- doom emacs
- vim
- spectacle
- google chrome (with vimium)
- terminal
- mac

* Keybinding Philosophy

** 40%

#+begin_quote
41 keys only
#+end_quote

** Spatially and sequentially aware
- Parantheses: Closing and opening should mirror each other.
- Numbers: Numbers increase in a row-by-row like a calculator.
- Symbol: $ is CMD+f because f is directly below 4
** Key-Chord-centric
- [ => a+s
- \ => o+p
** Eliminate Corner Movements
- caps lock => control (Single press will make caps lock esc)
- Delete/Backspace => Ctrl+h
- ` => CMD+v
